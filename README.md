Project Description

Infogather is an information gathering tool designed for cybersecurity professionals and researchers. It performs Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) activities, gathers data from various sources, and generates detailed PDF reports. This tool facilitates quick access to WHOIS, Shodan, geolocation data, reverse DNS, and reverse IP lookup results, making it easier to analyze and interpret security-related information.
Features
    WHOIS Lookup: Retrieves domain registration details.
    Shodan Integration: Fetches information about devices connected to the internet.
    Geolocation Lookup: Locates IP addresses geographically.
    PDF Report Generation: Generates customizable reports for scan results.
